    NOTE
    ====

    Below functions are "doubling up" a little and define Rayleigh calculations for both
    wavelength and wavenumbers. This is mostly for performance reasons; it guarantees
    type stability for the wavenumber of wavelength quantity. One could write one function
    only that checks the type inside the function, but this would make the function
    likely slower. So for the sake of performance, we have wrapper functions for both
    wavelength and wavenumber spectral units. HOWEVER there is only *one* function that
    actually implements the Rayleigh coefficient calculations, so there is one place
    where mistakes can occur there..

    #= Indices: [moment, (Greek) element]
        Greek elements must be ordered:
        β (l,1), α (l,2), ζ (l,3), δ (l,4), -γ (l,5), -ε (l,6)

        Be mindful of the fact that we use 1-based indexing here, whereas most literature
        will likely use 0-based indexing for the moments `l`, thus β0 in some paper will
        probably correspond to coef[1,1], or δ8 correspond to coef[9,4].

        As further explained in the documentation, we also observe the Siewert convention
        regarding the construction of the phase matrix expansion (for the time being, due
        to compatibility with XRTM). The elements (l,5) and (l,6) **must** correspond to
        -γ_l and -ε_l, and include the minus sign!

        Note the source from RtRetrievalFramework/Support/rayleigh_greek_moment.cc, and
        the VLIDORT documentation section 3.1.1.

        coef[3,5] = sqrt(6.0) * (1.0 - depolf) / (2.0 + depolf) # -γ2
        # Note the lack of minus in front!
        # XRTM uses requires "-γ" as input, rather than "γ"
