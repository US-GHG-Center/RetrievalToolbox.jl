                atmospheric elements are part of the atmosphere, what type of observer
                will be used, and so on. Hence, we must make a guess as to how many
                weighting functions will be used.

                A decent guess for the maximum number that we would ever need can be based
                off the number of layers. If we need per-layer derivatives for optical
                depth and single-scatter albedo, we would need 2xN_lay weighting
                functions.

                We only allocate this array once during the creation of the buffer, so
                there is no notable performance drawback by making this placeholder
                slightly larger than needed.
